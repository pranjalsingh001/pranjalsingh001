# Hey there! 👋 I’m Pranjal Singh (@pranjalsingh001)

I’m a **full-stack developer and computer science student** building **real, system-level products**, not isolated features. I work end-to-end — from **architecture and APIs** to **frontend UX**, **AI workflows**, and **execution environments**.

Most of my recent work focuses on **AI-assisted developer tools**, **production-style full-stack platforms**, and **scalable system design**.

---

## What I build

- **Full-stack web applications** using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- **AI-driven systems**: agent workflows, prompt orchestration, structured outputs, and tool-calling logic  
- **Developer platforms** (IDE-like systems, code generation, execution pipelines, Docker-based runners)  
- **Backend architecture**: modular services, REST APIs, real-time flows (Socket.IO), auth, sessions  
- **Web3 experiments**: Solidity smart contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721), Web3.js, on-chain interactions  
- **DevOps foundations**: Docker, environment isolation, deployment workflows  
- **UI for complex systems**: dashboards, editors, system-design views (HLD/LLD), real-time logs

---

## How I work

- I design before I code  
- I optimize for maintainability and scale, not demos  
- I ship fast, then iterate based on real feedback  
- I care about structure, naming, and long-term ownership

---

## What I’m looking for

Opportunities where I can work on **real products**, take **end-to-end ownership**, and grow alongside strong engineers while shipping software that’s actually used.

### 😄 Pronouns:
He/Him (but also responds to “Yo dev!” 🤙)

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I can spend hours tweaking shadows and animations — not because I have to… but because it brings UI to *life*. Oh, and I love building stuff people say “Whoa!” to.
