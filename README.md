# Hey there! 👋 I’m Pranjal Singh (@pranjalsingh001)

🚀 Tech explorer. 💡 Idea machine. 🛠️ Builder of cool things.  
I’m on a mission to turn futuristic dreams into real-world projects with code, design, and a lot of curiosity.

---

### 👀 What I'm into:
- Crafting 🔥 modern UIs with animations that *feel alive*
- Building full-stack apps that actually solve real problems
- Diving into Web3, smart contracts & the blockchain rabbit hole 🕳️🦇
- AI + Chatbots that *talk smart*, not just type fast
- Turning boring dashboards into visual experiences

---

### 🌱 Currently leveling up in:
- MERN Stack magic 🧙 (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- Solidity + Web3.js (Yes, I’m on-chain now!)
- DevOps basics — making my code fly 🚀 and scale 🌍
- Advanced CSS wizardry ✨ (because plain is pain)

---

### 💞️ Let’s collaborate if:
- You're building something bold, fun, and challenging
- You need frontend flair with backend brains
- You’ve got an idea and need someone who can turn it into pixels and logic 💻
- You love geeking out over design + code

### 😄 Pronouns:
He/Him (but also responds to “Yo dev!” 🤙)

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I can spend hours tweaking shadows and animations — not because I have to… but because it brings UI to *life*. Oh, and I love building stuff people say “Whoa!” to.
